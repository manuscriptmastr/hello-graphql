      content: "Senior Software Engineer, Tucker Legard, was hospitalized after a team lunch went mutinous. Legard said he was eating lunch with a team of designers at the Lampo Neopolitan Pizzeria. His coworkers reportedly overpowered him with hot sauce and tied him to his chair with microwaved string cheese, preventing him from administering water to his parched throat. Legard is making a slow but steady recovery. Report any suspicious designers to the human resources team."
